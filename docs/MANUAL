SYNOPSIS
	foil6 [ -n ] [ -N ] [ -v verb ] [ -V vars ] [ -s frac ] [ -m maxt ]
	      [ -d depth ] [ -w weaklits ] [ -a accur ] [ -l alter ]
	      [ -t chkpt ] [ -f gain ] [ -g max ]

DESCRIPTION
	foil6 is a program that learns Horn clauses from input comprising
	examples of one or more relations. More than one relation may be
	specified in the input file as the target relations that are to
	be learned by foil6. 

Input to the program consists of three sections:

        * specification of types
          blank line
        * extensional definitions of relations
          blank line                            |  these are
        * test cases for learned definitions    |  optional

Each discrete type specification consists of the type name followed by a 
colon, then a series of constants separated by commas and terminated with a 
period. This may occupy several lines and the same constant can appear in many
types. The names of types with fixed ordering shall be preceded by a '*' and 
arranged so that no constant appears before a "smaller" constant. The names
of types that are explicitly defined to be unordered shall be preceded by
a '#'. (FOIL will attempt to find an order for the constants in a type whose
name is preceded by neither '*' nor '#'). A constant is preceded by 
a '*' if it is to be permitted to appear in the Horn clause definition.
The missing value constant "?" is special - do not use "?" as the name of
a user defined constant, and do not enter it as a constant in the type
specification, as the program does that internally.

Each continuous type specification consists of the type name followed by
": continuous." on one line. There is no requirement to specify constants
of this type. Any string that can be converted to a float by C's atof()
should work when specifying a value in a tuple.

Constants consist of any string of characters with the exception that any
occurrence of certain delimiter characters (left and right parenthesis, period,
comma, semicolon) must be prefixed by the escape character '\', except that
a period may appear unprefixed if immediately followed by a digit. (The
latter exception has been added to make entry of floating point numbers
easier - avoid following periods by digits in other circumstances!).

All relations are defined in terms of the set of positive tuples of constants
for which the relation is true, and optionally the set of negative tuples of
constants for which it is false. If only positive tuples are given, all other
constant tuples of the correct types are considered to be negative.

Each relation is defined by a header and one or two sets of constant tuples.
The header can be specified as follows:

    name(type, type, ... , type) key/key/.../key

All relations other than target relations shall begin with '*' in the header.
The header consists of relation name, argument types and optional keys.
The type definition in the header shall be the one specified in the type
specification. The optional keys limit the ways the relation may be used. 
Each key consists of a string of characters, one for each type.  
The character '#' indicates that
the corresponding argument in a literal must be bound; the character '-'
indicates that the argument can be bound or unbound.  Each key thus gives
a permissible way of accessing the relation.  If no keys appear, all possible
combinations of bound and unbound arguments are allowed.

Following the header line are a series of lines containing constant tuples:

    positive tuple
    positive tuple
      . . .
    ;			| these
    negative tuple	| are
    negative tuple	| optional
      . . .		|
    .

Each tuple consists of constants separated by commas and must appear on a
single line.  The character ';' separates positive tuples from negative
tuples, which are optional.

The optional test relations may be given to test the learned Horn clause 
definitions.  The additional input consists of

        a blank line (indicating start of test relation specification)
        relation name
        test tuples
        .
        relation name
        test tuples
        .
          and so on

Each test tuple consists of a constant tuple followed by ": +" if it is 
positive tuple of the learned Horn clauses definition. Otherwise, test 
tuple shall be succeeded by ": -". Each test tuple that is handled
incorrectly by the definition is printed, along with the number of such
errors for that relation.  [**NB**: the definition interpreter is by default
simple; right-hand sides of the clauses are checked with reference to the
given tuples, not to the definitions of the relations that may have been
learned. If the -r option for recursive checking of test cases is used, then
those recursive occurrences of relations which satisfy the tuple check will
be further checked by testing against the definition. For this reason, the
clause order in the final definition will, (if necessary), be altered from the
order in which the clauses were found, to put recursive clauses after
non-recursive ones].

	Options and their meanings are:

        -n      Negative literals are not considered.  This may be useful in
                domains where negated literals wouldn't make sense, or if
                learned definitions must be Horn clauses.

	-N	This is similar, but permits negated equality literals
		A<>B and A<>constant.

        -vverb	Set verbosity level [0, 1, 2, 3, or 4; default 1]
                The program produces rather voluminous trace output controlled
                by this variable.  The default value of 1 gives a fair
                amount of detail; 0 produces very little output; 3 gives
                a blow-by-blow account of what the system is doing;
                4 gives details of tuples in training sets etc.

	-Vvars	Set the maximum number of variables that can be used during
		the search for a definition. [default: 52]

        -sfrac	In some predicates of high arity, the closed world assumption
                will generate very many negative tuples.  This option causes
                only a randomly-selected neg% of negative tuples to be used.
                Note that this option has no effect if negative tuples are
                given explicitly.

	-mmaxt	Set the maximum number of tuples; the default is 100000.
		If the default setting results in warnings that literals are
		being excluded due to the tuple limit, expanding the limit
		may be useful (but time-consuming).

        -ddepth	Set the maximum variable depth [default 4]. This limits the
                possible depth of variables in literals.

	-wwklts Set the maximum number of weak (zero-gain) literals that
		can appear in sequence [default: 4].  A batch of determinate
		literals counts as one literal in this respect.

        -aaccur	Set the minimum accuracy of any clause [default 80%]
                FOIL will not accept any clause with an accuracy lower
                than this.

	-lalter Set the maximum number of alternatives to any literal
		[default 5]. This limits the amount of backup from any 
		one point.

        -tchkpt	Set the maximum number of checkpoints at any one time 
		[default 20].

        -fgain	Any alternative literal must have at least gain%
                of the best literal gain [default 80%].  

        -gmax	Determinate literals are automatically included, unless
                there is a literal which has at least max% of the maximum
                possible gain.  (The maximum possible gain is achieved
                by a literal that is satisfied by all + tuples, but no
                - tuples, in the current training set.)  Obviously, if
                max is zero, no determinate literals are included unless
                there are no other literals.

	Options are specified in the usual Unix way, e.g.

		foil6 -v0 <infile >outfile
